    description: "It's not easy to live in the shadow of one of the craft beer capitals of America. Asheville, N.C. is widely recognized as one of the hotspots of craft - arguably the hotspot in the Southeast. But 128 miles to the east, the state's business hub and biggest city is starting to build a reputation of its own."

description: "Remember the last time you sat down and drank 12 beers? Neither do we. Because, like you, we've got better things to do, such as bringing a superior light beer to the world. And while our goal is beer-focused, we'd never get it done if we spent all of our time drinking beer."
